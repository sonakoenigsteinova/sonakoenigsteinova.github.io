<h1> Welcome! I am glad that you stopped by my HCI portfolio! </h1>

<img id="me-image" src="pics/me.JPG" alt="me being excited about HCI">

<h2>Rumor has it...</h2>
<p>... that I am a second-year UXD student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.
  I am a proffessional ice-figure skater and in my free time I love to knit sweaters for my 15 cats.
  My plans for 2019 and 2020 involve graduating, starting a master's degree an taking over the world.
  Those rumors are not true. Well, at least some of it.</p>

<h2>My expectations of this course...</h2>
<p>I expect greatness, insipration and gaining a new set of skills when working with new programmes
  I haven't worked with in ages (or never). I want to have fun and in the end, prove myself that I can build something
  very very cool in 9 days.
<br><br>
  Also, just for once I want to enjoy designing something with the technology in the center and not
  the user :) But really just for once.

<h2>What do I want to learn in this course...</h2>
<p>I want to learn a lot about new and trendy technologies of our age and learn how to design using
  these - how to prototype them what are their pros, cons and limitations and I want to create an idea
  of where we are heading to. In addition, I want to learn how different input and output devices
  communicate among each other.</p>
