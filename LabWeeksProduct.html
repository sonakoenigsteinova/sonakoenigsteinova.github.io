      <h2>Describe what your product is/does and how this relates to the topic (and/or others fields/research)</h2>
      <p>Lemon Maze is a game, where one or two players have to help Lemon the Robot get from start to the
        destination of the maze. Lemon is a small, confused artificial creature that is scared to go through
        the maze alone and very hesitant in which way to take, therefore he needs help.<br><br>

Lemon is an artificial creature. He uses proximity sensors as his eyes and ears and drives through the maze,
always checking where to go. As all the creatures, artificial or not, Lemon gets often unsure about his
decisions. This is expressed by a turnable movement from left to right.<br><br>

Our main topic was artificial creatures, but we wanted to implement some playfulness into the concept.
Therefore, we decided to make it a game, where the players have to help the creature and basically be his
co-players. We did this because many people are scared of robots and they think robots always play against
us. To me, the maze concept was a representation of that they can cooperate and help each other, too instead
of being afraid.

<h2>Describe how your product works. And how users interacted with it.</h2>
<p>The player(s) help lemon in 2 ways – they clear out the path for him turning the movable walls and
  they navigate him using the 2 paddles they are given at the beginning of the game. Using the paddles,
  they can imitate walls and give Lemon a signal that this is not the right path.<br><br>

The interaction during the expo went as expected. The players had a lot of fun navigating Lemon and were
even emotional when he was struggling or when he got to his destination – home. We received very good
feedback to the concept and had always people around, who wanted to play the game.
