<h1>Arduino Assignments</h1>

<p>All of these assignments were part of the Arduino workshop we have done as a part of our HCI class. The assignments were given to us as a PDF. There was 13 assignments in total but only the ones below are part of our portfolio.
You can find all the assignments <a href="https://blackboard.hhs.nl/bbcswebdav/pid-2737499-dt-content-rid-22452455_2/courses/CMD-G-HCI-02-13-2018/Arduino%20Manual%20v5.0.pdf">HERE</a>.</p>

<h2>3c</h2>
<p>The assignment was to make make the lightbulbs shine in an alternating tact. To do this, I added another lighbulb pinMode(12, output)
  into the void setup section. Then I copied the code I already had in the loop initially for 13 and
  changed all 13s to 12. This added a step in the loop. <br><br>

  I have sketched a timeline first on a paper to understand the follow-up of actions better.

  I needed to see the events that had to happen in the loop so that everything works and the order this happens in.
  Then I checked he syntax for these actions in the code from previous exercise and turned
  my paper-sketch into a Processing code. Voila!

<h2>4c</h2>
<p>The assignment was to extend the code we have been given in the previous part of this exercise
  and make one LED slowly fade in and at the same time the other LED fade out.
  I started off by trying to do this exercise with 2 for-loops, however, I quickly realised it
was a mistake as there was no way they could run simultaneously.<br><br>

I knew I only had one option: packing both lights into one for loop. I tried plenty of combinations
before I decided to change the int brightness into x. that took away some of the confusion and helped
me to get to the right answer. For demonstration purposes, I changed it then back to brightness. Also,
I changed the green light bulb for red as one could see the dimming better on red.</p>

<h2>6c</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we used the input from the potentiometer and the fading LEDs we have done
  in Exercise 4. We were supposed to change the code we have been given so that one LED fades
  in while the other fades out and vice versa, depending on the values given by the potmeter.
Since the potmeter gives values between 0-1023, it needed to be rescaled for 0-255 as this is
the range for controlling the LED's. I did this using sensorValue. From there on it was only
about reusing the code from Exercise 4.</p>

<h2>7</h2>

<p>This exercise was about controlling the LED's using light as an input. To get this kind of
  input, we used the light sensors. We needed the sensors so we could dim the LEDs, which was
  the point of the exercise. Since this assignment was very similiar to number 6, I recycled
  the code we have been given there. One thing that needed to be done differently is the rescalling.
  Previoulsly, we have been using a potmeter. Now we had a light sensor. We needed to scale the light
  sensors based on the light availbale in the room. This was done using the Serial monitor and the
  sensorValue function.</p>

<h2>9b</h2>

<p>This exercise was amazing! We were supposed to change the Processing code to use the sensor value in an other interesting way.
 My change for the code was about using the input of the light sensor to determine the colour of the circle. I had to rescale
the range to 0-255 in Arduino and then just change the output code in Processing. I didn’t want the
2nd RGB value to be the same as the first one, so I divided the number by 2. I also experimented with
other ways how to make the 2nd RGB value different. It all worked perfectly and immediately without any
problem. <br><br>
I loved how we had the chance to use Processing with the input from Arduino.
It opened a whole new world of possibilities and made me think about how much more you could do with
Arduino connected to another programme. We were given the base for the Processing code, which made
things way easier, especially after such a long break from Processing.</p>

<h2>10f</h2>
<p>This exercise looked at the first sight a bit scary but in the end turned out to be very  easy to
  execute. It was about controlling LEDs with 2 buttons, more accurately the LED should have lighten
  up when one button of the two buttons wass pressed, but not both. I had to check the syntax online
  of how to make & (and) work, but I knew it was possible because I have used & in a code like this
  before. From there, it was just simple logic and using
  the code provided. I struggled a bit at the beginning as I had one of the buttons plugged into the
  wrong pin and therefore the code didn’t work. However, once I found the mistake, everything ran
  smoothly. Sometimes I still make such stupid mistakes like forgetting a bracket and the more I code,
  the easier it is to fix these mistake without any unnecessary frustration. This happened here, too and
  I felt very accomplished after fixing it very quickly and making everything work.</p>

<h2>11b</h2>

<p>While doing this assignment, I felt like a legit crazy person. The assignment was about changing
  the code we have been given in a way that the servo will move in a more interesting, funny way or teach the servo a dance.
  Naturally, I chose the dance. <br><br>
  Already after seeing the servo move for the first time after uploading the code from the Arduino Manual, I got inspired and knew I had
  to set my goal for the dance to something like: “I need to make it move to Billie Jean by Michael
  Jackson.” I did this literally by playing around with the length of delays and the positions of the
  servo. After each try, I just uploaded the code to my Arduino board, looked at the execution and
  had Billie Jean playing in the background. Afterwards I went back to the text editor, adjust the
  intervals and re-uploaded it to the board. I did this until I felt like it was good enough and looked
  like a pretty good Billie Jean dance. I hope that Michael would be proud.</p>

<h2>12b</h2>
<p>The assignment asked us to build a circuit with a servo and 2 buttons. These buttons were
  supposed to control the servo. One button should move the servo clockwise and the other counter-clockwise.
  First though of mine after reading the assignment was that this can be done with an if-statement. The way I create if statements is just by writing it all down in sentences before I turn it into
code. That's what I did now, too.<br><br>

If the right button is pressed, the position of the servo changes by 1 to the right. If the left
button is pressed, the position of the servo changes by one to the left. <br><br>

This gave me a better idea of how to do it and what to declare. This technique is very simple and
together with sketching, I apply it a lot when coding. It always helps me to come up with the simplest
code possible which works, too and it helps me to tidy up and organise my thoughts.

<h2>13b</h2>
<p>For me, this was the most fun assignment of them all.  We were supposed to adjust the code so that
  the speaker plugged into the circuit it plays a creative melody.<br><br>
  At first, I was very confused and didn’t know where to start,
  as I can’t play any instrument and don’t understand notes and accords at all. I was literally just
  sitting there, trying out different combinations to create something new. <br><br>
Because it all sounded pretty bad, I went to youtube and watched videos of people playing simple piano
music with accords. That one time I wanted to learn how to play piano, I started with a song called
Comptine d'un Autre Été by Yann Tiersen. I didn’t manage to learn it till the end but I told myself I
would do it at least for this assignment. I chose to recreate it according to this video:</p>

<p>Then used the chart we were provided to translate the notes in the video into code/frequency.</p>
