<h1>Arduino Assignments</h1>
<h2>3c</h2>
<p>To make the lightbulbs shine in an alternating tact, I added another lighbulb pinMode(12, output)
  into the void setup section. Then I copied the code I already had in the loop initially for 13 and
  changed all 13s to 12. this added a step in the loop. <br><br>

  I have sketched a timeline first on a paper that looked like this:

  I did this to see the events that need to happen in the loop so that everything works.
  Then I checked he syntax for these actions in the code from previous exercise and turned
  my sketch into code.

<h2>4c</h2>
<p>I started off by trying to do this exercise with 2 for-loops, however, I quickly realised it
was a mistake as there was no way they could run simultaneously.

So I knew I only had one option: packing both lights into one for loop. I tried plenty of combinations
before I decided to change the int brightness into x. that took away some of the confusion and helped
me to get to the right answer. For demonstration purposes, I changed it then back to brightness. Also,
I changed the green light bulb for red as one could see the dimming better on red.</p>

<h2>9b</h2>

<p>This exercise was amazing! I loved how we had the chance to use Processing with the input from Arduino.
It opened a whole new world of possibilities and made me think about how much more you could do with
Arduino connected to another programme. We were given the base for the Processing code, which made
things way easier, especially after such a long break from Processing. My change for the code was
about using the input of the light sensor to determine the colour of the circle. I had to rescale
the range to 0-255 in Arduino and then just change the output code in Processing. I didn’t want the
2nd RGB value to be the same as the first one, so I divided the number by 2. I also experimented with
other ways how to make the 2nd RGB value different. It all worked perfectly and immediately without any
problem.</p>

<h2>10f</h2>
<p>This exercise looked at the first sight a bit scary but in the end turned out to be very  easy to
  execute. I had to check the syntax online of how to make & (and) work, but I knew it was possible
  because I have used & in a code like this before. From there, it was just simple logic and using
  the code provided. I struggled a bit at the beginning as I had one of the buttons plugged into the
  wrong pin and therefore the code didn’t work. However, once I found the mistake, everything ran
  smoothly. Sometimes I still make such stupid mistakes like forgetting a bracket and the more I code,
  the easier it is to fix these mistake without any unnecessary frustration. This happened here, too and
  I felt very accomplished after fixing it very quickly and making everything work.</p>

<h2>11b</h2>

<p>While doing this assignment, I felt like a legit crazy person. Already after seeing the servo move
  for the first time after uploading the code from the Arduino Manual, I got inspired and knew I had
  to set my goal for the dance to something like: “I need to make it move to Billie Jean by Michael
  Jackson.” I did this literally by playing around with the length of delays and the positions of the
  servo. After each try, I just uploaded the code to my Arduino board, looked at the execution and
  had Billie Jean playing in the background. Afterwards I went back to the text editor, adjust the
  intervals and re-uploaded it to the board. I did this until I felt like it was good enough and looked
  like a pretty good Billie Jean dance. I hope that Michael would be proud.</p>

<h2>12b</h2>
<p>This had to be for me the most difficult exercise, also because my Arduino has been going crazy
  so I wasn’t able to check if he code was correct until I borrowed another Arduino from a friend.
The way I if statements is just by writing it all down in sentences before I turn it into code.<br><br>

If the right button is pressed, the position of the servo changes by 1 to the right. If the left
button is pressed, the position of the servo changes by one to the left. <br><br>

This gave me a better idea of how to do it and what to declare. This technique is very simple and
together with sketching, I apply it a lot when coding. It always helps me to come up with the simplest
code possible which works, too and it helps me to tidy up and organise my thoughts.

<h2>13b</h2>
<p>This was the most fun of them all for me. First, I was very confused and didn’t know where to start,
  as I can’t play any instrument and don’t understand notes and accords at all. I was literally just
  sitting there, trying out different combinations to create something new. <br><br>
Because it all sounded pretty bad, I went to youtube and watched videos of people playing simple piano
music with accords. That one time I wanted to learn how to play piano, I started with a song called
Comptine d'un Autre Été by Yann Tiersen. I didn’t manage to learn it till the end but I told myself I
would do it at least for this assignment. I chose to recreate it according to this video:</p>

<p>Then used the chart we were provided to translate the notes in the video into code/frequency.</p>
