      <h2>Assignment 1 - Rotating Banana</h2>

      <p>This assignment was so complicated, it took me 2 days. We were supposed to animate a rotating
        banana in Unreal Engine, following a beginner's tutorial we were provided with.
        It was not even the complexity of the
        assignment itself, but more my unfamilirity with Unreal Engine as it does not look like any
        programme I have worked with in the past. I have also made some tiny mistakes throughout and it
        took me a long time to fix those as I was (and still am) a newbie. Anyway, here is the result of
        my efforts. In the end, I made a banana turn. How cool is that!</p>

      <h2>Assignment 2 - The Banana Game</h2>

      <p>This assignment went a little bit smoother than the first one. We animated a rotating banana,
        now it was time to create a game, where the player has to collect bananas in the playing field.
        We were supposed to do this in Unreal Engine, following another tutorial we were given a link to.
        I had a better idea of where to
        search for Nodes, Meshes, how to compile and how the whole software works in general. I really liked
        that the outcome was an actual game! So unreal, right? I have again made several mistakes in te process
        that I needed to fix, too and got frustrated so many times. But I felt very accomplished in the end,
        while I was collecting the bananas in the game I created myself. However, I have to admit that Unreal
        Engine pushed my boundaries multiple times during working on the assignments.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 3 - Projection Mapping</h2>
        <p>The projection mapping assignment was to use MadMapper, a projection software to project
          multiple layers of images or video onto an uneven, layered surface.<br><br>
        My projection mapping project was creating an interactive mirror, which would reflect
        the image from my webcam onto the face-figure and the wall. People are having a lot of fun
        with it, so I was happy, Although it consists of only 2 layers, the layers were pretty hard
        to fit onto the mannequine. Everyone around me tried reflecting some kind of artsy patterns
        onto the objects and I wanted to do it differently, therefore I used the webcam for a real-life
        input. It was very hard to film in with my phone because of the light emmited by the projector
        in a dark room, so I am sorry for the video quality.</p>
