      <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
      <p>Write a program that draws three (or more) ellipses:
<ul>
  <li>at various locations,</li>
  <li>with various colors,</li>
  <li>various widths and heights,</li>
  <li>with and without borders (of various colors)</li>
</ul>
Copy or printscreen your (aligned) code and give a screenshot of the result in the display window.</p>

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<p>Write a program that draws:
<ul>
  <li>at least four different shapes (not circles),</li>
  <li>in various colors,</li>
  <li>at various locations.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
<p>Write a program that draws at least two different shapes, with various colors and make them interactive.<br><br>
Ideas:
<ul>
    <li>Draw a line where one of the ends follows the mouse.</li>
    <li>Draw a circle where the color is related to the location of the mouse.</li>
    <li>Draw a rectangle with the size related to the x location of the mouse.</li>
    <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment CV1</h2>

<p>Now it's time to start experimenting. Take a good look at the LiveCamTest code you just opened.<br>
Can you discover which line causes a rectangle to be drawn around a recognized face? (Tip: rect = rectangle).
Adjust the code so that a circle is drawn instead of a rectangle.</p>

<img id="big-image" src="pics/assignmentCV1.jpg" alt="Computer Vision Assignment">

<p>People always tell me I have a very round face! Well, I guess they were right.</p>

<h2>Assignment CV2</h2>
<p>Adjust the code so that every recognised face gets an 'anonymous' black bar in front of his eyes or a red
  clown nose instead of his/her nose.</p>

<img id="big-image" src="pics/assignmentCV2.jpg" alt="Computer Vision Assignment">

<p>Being a Processing clown is pretty creepy as well :/</p>

<h2>Bonus Assignment</h2>
<p>Adjust the code so that every recognised image is enhanced by an image, e.g. give a recognized face funny
  glasses or a hat.</p>

<img id="big-image" src="pics/assignmentBonus.jpg" alt="Computer Vision Assignment">

<p>I always wanted to have a hat like this!</p>

<h2>Assignment CV3</h2>
<p>Adjust the code of one of the examples so that something cool happens.</p>

<p>The lighbulb always appears above the brightest spot, so you know where the light is coming from ;)</p>

<h2>Assignment AR</h2>
<p>I had real trouble finishing this assignment. I tried to add a marker into the existing code on the
  position the screenshot shows, but processing kept crashing because of it. I also added a picture into
  the folder where the other markers were located in various different formats, but ptocessing kept crashing
  each time i ran the code. Afterwards I located the files of the workinf markers in hopes to find out what
  format they are in, but all I got out of it was Format: Document. At that point, I decided to try one
  more thing. I thought that maybe processing was crashing because it had a limit of 2 markers at the same
  time, so I commented out one of the original markers and left there the one I created. Nothing worked,
   so I googled in hopes to get some help, but I did not find anything. I
  also asked around in our class-Whatsapp group, but there was nobody who could help me. That is how "Mission:
  add your own marker" ended.</p>

  <p>... so at least I decided to take pictures with the existing AR creations. They did not work on my
    phone, but it worked on an iPhone 6. Yaaaay!</p>
