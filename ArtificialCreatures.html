      <h2>Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Homeostasis of a printer</h3>
      <p><br><br>
<u>Need to be entertained</u><br><br>
Offices - the heaven for printers. Not because of fancy people dressed in business casual, but because of
the constant printing. Invoices, letters, emails, copies, notes, contracts...Everything exciting on one
place. The more, the better. Five days a week, every day a high dosis of adrenaline and beautiful office
stress! Sometimes even more than 5 days a week. How awesome!<br><br>
<u>Expressing the creativity</u><br><br>
Pictures, texts, stickers, tshirts, cups. Black and white or rainbow, all over the page or not. Everyday something new!
Each printer has a need to express its' creativity, sometimes in the most unusual way. Have you ever printed
a text in black and white and then you found it all in green? Yes! Because your printer decided to do it this
way. What about printing a picture on a full page and realising that the edges are thicker than you wanted
them to be? Also your printers' creativity.<br><br>
<u>A need to catch up</u><br><br>
Being a printer and living a family life is difficult. Most of the time you're asleep, but the fun starts
when the family member presses the ON button, the printer wakes up and prints everything the children
queued there over the last 2 weeks, and the dad has to wait for all the unicorn colourings until he can
get his email print-out. After a long printing session, half-dry cartridge and an almost empty paper tray,
the printer can go back to sleep and wait, until he wakes up again and has some catching up to do.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>Sophia, a humanoid robot by Hanson Robotics (First activated: 14th of February 2016)</h3>

<p>This video shows you a robot called Sophia. Sophia is very interesting social robot. She has an AI software enabling her to process visual data, conversations, and face recognition and even form relationships.
<br><br>Sophia is a very good example of something humans are often scared off: that these robots, which look and act like humans will once be The humans. The creator’s intention for Sophia was that she should be helping out in nursing homes, events etc.
<br><br>Sophia can not only read emotions, but he can also express them through her hand gestures and mimic. I think the difference between humans and Sophia in this case is that Sophia doesn’t feel the emotions internally just like humans do. But that doesn’t seem so hard to do.
<br><br>I personally don’t know how to feel about Sophia. I would say that the uncanny valley effect applies to be but then I have to admit that she is equally scary as she is fascinating. However, she looks a lot like all the Hollywood sci-fi movies predicted. Based on the scenarios of these stories I can’t really see her as something very positive. I hope that once I will be proven wrong.

<h3>AlphaGo, an AI self-learning algorithm by DeepMind (an AI division of Google)</h3>

<iframe id="video" width="806" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8tq1C8spV_g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>AlphaGo first got the attention of public, when it won the ancient Chinese board-game Go by outsmarting its opponent - Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world by correctly predicting the human intuition and reacting accordingly. This has been very fascinating as this AI machine achieved the win by learning on its own by mimicking the learning process of a human instead of using calculations, as we are used to with computer programs.
<br><br>This has been a shock to the world. The scientists knew, something like this would be possible, but predicted it would take at least a decade.
<br><br>The difference of DeepMind’s strategy towards other AI’s like Siri, Watson or Cortana is that DeepMind is using deep reinforcement learning - making their AI’s learn from experience rather than being developed only for a predefined purpose and therefore only function within their scope.
<br><br>Since mastering Go, Alpha Go has been seen to play many other board and computer games and has revolutionised not just the world of gaming, but also the world of technology and the world in general.
<br><br>If you ask me, I think it takes away the whole charm of gaming. Winning over an Ai would be very cool, but it seems to be rather impossible. People believed this whole time that if you practise enough, you can once become the top-player and that kept them going. With AlphaGo, it looks more like no matter how much you try, you will never be the best.
The important question is: How can we use this very cool AI in our advantage? What measures need to be taken, so that humans stay on top of the food chain for many more years to come? Because to me, it looks like machines will be taking over maybe earlier than we thought.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p>This topic is just sooo controversial and honestly, a little repealing, but offers so many possibilities for creating something new. As a UX designer, I think it is very important that I am present while these kind of creatures are being created as the UX designers have the power to make them more appealing and set the borders for the functionalities, so that the user is not afraid of them. That is why I decided to put it into my first choice - to tackle it and come up with something very cool and not creepy.<p/>
