      <h2>Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Homeostasis of a printer</h3>
      <p>A main function of a printer is to print. In order to do this, the printer has needs, which need to
        fulfilled, so that the printing can happen and the main function would work. <br><br>
<u>Energy</u><br><br>
Similarly to humans, a printer could not work without having a source of energy. This usually means a
connection to a socket. If a person has low energy levels, there are still some actions he/she is able
to perform (talking, thinking, eating etc.) In contrast to humans, a printer needs a certain amount of
energy to function and there is no “low energy levels” state. This is affected mainly by the ability and
functionality of the socket.<br><br>
<u>The canvas (eg. paper)</u><br><br>
The printer needs something, on which it can turn the data into an image. Depending on a printer type,
this could be anything from wood, cd’s, textiles, food, metals to paper. Without this “background”, the
printer can do the printing movement but with no outcome. There also needs to be someone or something to
make sure that the printer has enough of this material. <br><br>
<u>Cartridge</u><br><br>
We have all been there. The red light is blinking, the printer ran out of ink. The ink levels in a printer
are naturally affected by the amount and the attributes (colours, size, quality etc.) of the printed areas.
But how does it feel for the device? Some printers are okay with it They just do their best and print what
they can. There are also the printers - perfectionists, who refuse to do anything before they get a new
cartridge. These live by the motto “I give it my all or I don’t do it at all”.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>Sophia, a humanoid robot by Hanson Robotics (First activated: 14th of February 2016)</h3>


<iframe id="video" width="806" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G-zyTlZQYpE?start=273" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This video shows you a robot called Sophia. Sophia is very interesting social robot. She has an AI software enabling her to process visual data, conversations, and face recognition and even form relationships.
<br><br>Sophia is a very good example of something humans are often scared off: that these robots, which look and act like humans will once be The humans. The creator’s intention for Sophia was that she should be helping out in nursing homes, events etc.
<br><br>Sophia can not only read emotions, but he can also express them through her hand gestures and mimic. I think the difference between humans and Sophia in this case is that Sophia doesn’t feel the emotions internally just like humans do. But that doesn’t seem so hard to do.
<br><br>I personally don’t know how to feel about Sophia. I would say that the uncanny valley effect applies to be but then I have to admit that she is equally scary as she is fascinating. However, she looks a lot like all the Hollywood sci-fi movies predicted. Based on the scenarios of these stories I can’t really see her as something very positive. I hope that once I will be proven wrong.

<h3>AlphaGo, an AI self-learning algorithm by DeepMind (an AI division of Google)</h3>

<iframe id="video" width="806" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8tq1C8spV_g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>AlphaGo first got the attention of public, when it won the ancient Chinese board-game Go by outsmarting its opponent - Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world by correctly predicting the human intuition and reacting accordingly. This has been very fascinating as this AI machine achieved the win by learning on its own by mimicking the learning process of a human instead of using calculations, as we are used to with computer programs.
<br><br>This has been a shock to the world. The scientists knew, something like this would be possible, but predicted it would take at least a decade.
<br><br>The difference of DeepMind’s strategy towards other AI’s like Siri, Watson or Cortana is that DeepMind is using deep reinforcement learning - making their AI’s learn from experience rather than being developed only for a predefined purpose and therefore only function within their scope.
<br><br>Since mastering Go, Alpha Go has been seen to play many other board and computer games and has revolutionised not just the world of gaming, but also the world of technology and the world in general.
<br><br>If you ask me, I think it takes away the whole charm of gaming. Winning over an Ai would be very cool, but it seems to be rather impossible. People believed this whole time that if you practise enough, you can once become the top-player and that kept them going. With AlphaGo, it looks more like no matter how much you try, you will never be the best.
The important question is: How can we use this very cool AI in our advantage? What measures need to be taken, so that humans stay on top of the food chain for many more years to come? Because to me, it looks like machines will be taking over maybe earlier than we thought.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p>This topic is just sooo controversial and honestly, a little repealing, but offers so many possibilities for creating something new. As a UX designer, I think it is very important that I am present while these kind of creatures are being created as the UX designers have the power to make them more appealing and set the borders for the functionalities, so that the user is not afraid of them. That is why I decided to put it into my first choice - to tackle it and come up with something very cool and not creepy.<p/>
