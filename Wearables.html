      <h3> New ways of social interaction</h3>
      <h4>The Sketch-band</h4>

      <p>Do you know the situation, when you re trying to explain a design, which just came to your
        mind to your designer colleagues, but you can’t sketch it exactly the way you see it, because
        your drawing abilities are lacking?
        Well, I do too. And therefore, I came up with a concept for Sketch-Band.
        Sketch-Band is a headband, which creates realistic images of your ideas using the biometric
        brainwave data . Thanks to the special software installed into the Sketch-Band the images from
        your mind will be turned into high-quality sketches in no time, so you and your designer colleagues
        can fully understand the idea you have been trying to communicate.
        Sketch-band can be easily wirelessly connected to any device with a screen. The screen will serve
        Sketch-band as a canvas fo your imagination and you will never have to let your drawing skills limit
        your ideas and creativity. Not a fan of screens? Get your colleagues their own sketch-band, so they
        can see your ideas in real time.
        Sketch-band has two modes: The Presenter and The Collaborator. The Presenter is the person, whose
        ideas will be shown. The Collaborators are the spectators, who see The Presenter’s ideas. You can
        switch at anytime between these 2 modes using a simple hand gesture.
        Since every designer breaks a sweat while coming up with life-changing concepts, Sketch-band was
        designed to be easily washed in your washing machine with the rest of your laundry.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>Wearable Artificial Kidney</h3>

      <p>End stage renal disease is the most severe stage of chronic kidney disease. The patients’ kidneys
        work only at about 10-15% of their capacity and therefore the patients waiting for a new kidney
        need a dialysis, where each session takes about 4 hours and is usually done 3 times a week.
        Wearable Artifical Kidney (WAK) tries to solve this problem by a device, which does the dialysis
        for the patient, without any medical assistance and at any place. It does so by using sorbent
        technology, which removes uremic toxins from the used dialysis fluid and produces fresh fluid.
        For a better picture, the current modalities require about 10-12 l of fluid per session.
        This is a very interesting and different concept for a wearable that could change lives of many
        patients, who are currently in need of dialysis and could give them a chance to lead a “more
        normal” life. As artificial implants are still in a further future, the WAK is a great compromise.
        What I especially like about this concept is that unlike the wearables out there right now, this
        device solves a physical problem rather than just does some tracking and statistics.<p/>

      <h3>Honeywell 8670 Ringscanner</h3>

      <p>This spiderman-looking device attached to the arm is not shooting spiderwebs, but makes you fast
        as a superhero when working in a warehouse. Honeywell developed this ring scanner to make scanning
        more effective.
This is a very interesting concept, as to me it looks like a decomposed hand-held scanner not just visually,
but also by the technology used. The scanner uses a laser light, which reflects back off the barcode into
a light-detecting electronic component called a photoelectric cell. The device has a small computer with a
touchscreen and some basic interface attached to the arm of the user, from where the user can control what
he/she is doing - just like a handheld scanner would. I think this device can come in very handy for those,
who need 2 free hands and a scanner at the same time and are tired of carrying a handheld scanner always
with them. The ring-scanner is a perfect example of a wearable one often wouldn’t even categories as a
wearable. This might be because of its very specific user target group or the fact that it is used in the
industry and it is closely bound to one activity. Another possible misconception with wearables might be
that the user should wear them all day and all night long, which is definitely not the case for the ring
scanner.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Wearables are just so in trend right now, rolling o the quantified-self train and I can’t say I
        hate it. As an Apple watch owner, I am attracted to the idea of a functional wearable but I also
        think it is really difficult to design one that would be working properly and fit well into
        people’s everyday life. At the moment, I think the most popular wearable is a smartwatch, but I
        see a lot of opportunities for the usage of wearables for medical patients with certain kinds of
        diseases or as a prevention devices for elderly. During my research, the ring scanner made me
        realise, how many devices have been a wearable before we started to call them wearables.
        All in all, I am very excited to see what else the future (maybe even me) brings to the market.
