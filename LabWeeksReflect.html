      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <h2>Are you content with your product? And why? Does it achieve what you set out to do?</h2>

      <p>During the first two days of the Lab Weeks, I was content with the product. As the time went by,
        I became less and less content with it, as I didn’t feel any real development happening. I have had
        several attempts at pushing it further, however, I always appeared to be in the minority so the
        changes to the concept were just denied. Several opportunities were presented to the group to push
        ourselves, get out of our comfort zone and deliver more than just enough, but most of my group was
        already happy with what was there and wasn’t willing to go the extra mile. This made me frustrated
        and demotivated, but I was pushing through and didn’t let that affect the quality of my work and my
        professionalism. I haven’t been content with our product until the very end of the Lab Weeks.
        However, when I saw people enjoying playing with it at the Expo and having a great time, it made me
        happy.<br><br>On day 1, we set ourselves some goals of what we wanted to deliver, and we did deliver
        exactly that. We had a well working maze and a creature walking through the maze using proximity
        sensors. The maze ended up being a tiny bit bigger than predicted, but that was just a result of all
        the prototyping and tinkering we have been doing mostly throughout the first five days of the Lab
        Weeks.</p>

        <h2>What is the quality of your product? Try to quantify/objectively express this.</h2>
        <p>Judging the quality of the execution of our concept, I would give this a solid 9/10. We have been
          testing a lot throughout the process which enabled us to fix all mistakes that would have affected
          the functionality. I didn’t give the execution a 10/10 as the Zumo got sometimes stuck in some walls
          and that was something we just couldn’t fix, although we tried. Additionally, if there was a new
          version of the prototype, I would definitely make the movable parts sturdier and more durable as
          people can be pretty violent while being in the game mode. However, in the end these “problems”
          didn’t seem to affect the user in any negative way and showed me that even though a product is not
          perfect for me or it is only in early stages, these small bugs and imperfections do not have such a
          huge impact on the overall experience. We have done a great deal of testing and if we continued
          working on the project, we wouldn’t stop a we saw that testing really pays off. Zumo worked for the
          full 4 hours without any difficulties and we were able to deliver everything we promised. </p>

          <h2>Reflect on the process that you have gone through and compare your work/effort to that of the
            group.</h2>
          <p>As already mentioned at the beginning of this reflection, I think the process we have gone
            through was okay but didn’t support iterations and wasn’t open to expanding the idea. The CMD
            students had a very different style of working compared to the UXD students and they also held
            the majority of the votes in the group. Our process was more of a waterfall than agile. Very
            early on, we came up with a concept that for some people in the group was set in stone and
            untouchable. This made accepting any ideas for making a change for the better impossible,
            which was seen negatively by Drew and me, as that is exactly what we are taught to do and used
            to doing – killing our darlings, being flexible and fearless.<br><br>The work ethic and the
            effort put into the project is something that is difficult to reflect on. We had a group where
            everyone was an “expert” in a different field, so our cooperation reminded the cooperation of a
            real product team. Leon was the tech lead, Emma was a construction expert, Drew was the
            designer/concept creator and I was the strategist/concept creator/ product manager. Only Lynette
            had a problem with finding a specific role in the team and as a result, this caused a lot of
            misunderstandings and group dynamics issues. Many of the group members, including me were not
            content with her work and found it difficult to understand her thought processes. In addition,
            because of her dominant character, she caused a lot of trouble in the group work, communication
            and the overall atmosphere. The peak for all 4 of us came when she disappeared from our stand right
            at the start of the expo, acted as a visitor the entire time and wasn’t standing there, explaining
            the concept to public like the rest of us did. The rest of us tried our best to bring this project
            to a successful end and were there to help each other out when needed and that is something I am
            very grateful for.</p>

            <h2>How did you spend your time, tell something about this?</h2>

            <p>I spent most of my time concepting, ideating and gathering materials. I felt a great responsibility
              for the overall success of the project and tried put my knowledge of a generalist to use. I put
              concepting as the strongest skill of mine in the questionnaire, which at the beginning put a lot of
              pressure and high expectations onto me. I was really surprised how easy it was for me to come up with
              great ideas at Maakhaven and therefore I didn’t disappoint myself as a concept creator. Most of my
              time I spent by keeping an eye onto everyone, answering the general questions about the concept,
              giving feedback and asking critical questions while helping Drew with the design and maze
              construction. If we needed to get something from a store, I was usually sent out to get it because
              of my strategist/supervisor’s role. I was always present and on time, working 9AM to 5PM with my
              group, giving the project my best.</p>

            <h2>Were you motivated? Were your expectations met? Did you have a good time? Did you learn a lot? Why?
              Why not?</h2>

              <p>To say that I was motivated the entire time would be a lie. I had some downs, especially under the
                atmosphere we sometimes worked in and the view of the project my group had, as already discussed.
                However, I didn’t let my demotivation affect neither the amount nor the quality of my work.
                During the project, I did not think that the Lab Weeks met my expectations, but this has changed
                thanks to the expo. I know we shouldn’t be comparing ourselves to other groups and it was no
                competition, but it helped me realize what a cool thing we built in 9 days even through all the
                difficulties we have been facing. And most importantly for me, that the visitors enjoyed it too.
                <br><br>I have learnt a lot. A lot about sensors, Arduino, how to give an impression of an
                artificial creature executing a certain behavior, group work and a through the great guest lectures
                we have been presented with. I have learnt that if you work hard, you can build amazing stuff in 9
                days, because all the 135ish people in the room did it. I have learnt a lot about materials and that
                not every material is compatible with each sensor and that testing will give you an answer. And last
                but not least, I got to know great people, who were always there to help each other and let no man
                stay behind :)</p>
