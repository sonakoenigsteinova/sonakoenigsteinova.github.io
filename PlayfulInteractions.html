      <h2>Assignment</h2>

      <p>One of the problems I see a lot is people using the elevator for any floors - higher or lower. In the morning, this slows down the elevators and people who actually need to get fast from A to B cant do so as the elevator stops on each floor. Yet, people still think the elevator is the fastest way to get up and 99% of the times choose it instead of taking the stairs.

<br><br>I think stairs have become very underrated and todays “lazy” society doesn’t use them enough. Therefore, my design challenge will be to encourage the students and teachers of THUAS to use stairs in the building using a playful interaction.
</p>

<b>StairsMaster</b>

<p>People think elevator is faster, so let’s prove them otherwise by becoming the stairs master.

<br><br>I would create a competition of running stairs. Each participant would use his campus card or his online student card to check in at start and would run up to their desired floor. In the middle of the staircase, there would be small prototypes of elevators that would move in the real time speed of the elevators in use right now. This would motivate the participant to be faster than the elevator. Towards the end, the participant could see the time it took him, the time it would take to make this journey with an elevator at that time of the day as well as show first names of people with best times.

<br><br>This concept would encourage people to move more and engage in a little bit of exercise as well as leave the elevators to those who really need it to get (fast) from one floor to another.

<br><br>Type of play modus: single player, competitive, parallel

      <h3>The Monkey Pond</h3>

      <p>This concept is basically about projecting onto the water level with a projector. To detect motion or what appears to us as touch, I assume motion sensor have been used. There is also a device called AirBar, which turns any device’s screen into a touch screen by projecting an invisible light-field over an ordinary screen. I can also imagine a device like this to be used for turning the water into a touchscreen.

<br><br>I really like this concept of an interactive water level also because it looks very original to me and it’s probably the first time I am seeing this. It looks very sci-fi inspired, too.

<br><br>Type of play modus: single player but could be a multiplayer, depending, competitive or cooperative or parallel or independent actions - depending on what s being projected

<h3>Calorie Counting Stairs</h3>

<img id="sketchband-image" src="pics/stairs.png" alt="Stairs">

<p>While doing some desk research about playful design and interfaces, i came across this very simple but so motivating way of turning stairs into a calorie counting “device”. I think it is very smart and persuasive enough, so that people actually choose the stairs over an elevator. Of course the context of the placement is very important, too. I think a great placement for this would be for example stairs leading to the gym. I can also imagine such motivating stair stickers to be used within other themes and on other places. I the simplicity of this idea and the materials used make is also very affordable, easy to do and effective.

<h3>Joggobot</h3>

<p>Another great example of a playful way how to motivate a user would be the Joggobot. It is a very effective way of using drones to motivate people to keep on jogging. I love this idea because I think it can be very effective and would definitely work on me (if I liked jogging).
<br><br><b>How does it work?</b><br><br>
The drone recognises the player according to the markings on his/her t-shirt and is flying in front of the player, dictating the running pace and keeping a set distance in between. The Joggobot always stays in front of the player so that the players do not feel chased. If the Joggobot doesn’t see the markings on the t-shirt, it lands onto the ground. I assume that the drone has a camera vision recognising colours and patterns and a proximity sensor. These help the drone with keeping an appropriate distance.

Type of play modus: single player so far but could be easily a multiplayer, competitive, parallel

      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p><b>What did you think of this topic?</b><br><br>
I didn’t like this topic very much. I think playfulness and playful interactive systems and games can be an amazing way how to affect behaviour. However, I am unsure how entertaining these systems are after a longer period of time, when the reaction which was surprising in the first place is no longer surprising. Also, with some examples it was pretty difficult to identify and describe the player modus as they were not really games, just playful ways of how to influence behaviour.
<br><br><b>How do you see applications and the future of this?</b><br><br>
I do see opportunities for using gamification and playfulness in the future, but I think it needs to be done with a lot of though going into the application and it is very challenging to find the balance between playful and childish.
<br><br><b>Did the subject meet your expectations?</b><br><br>
Unfortunately not. Everytime we have a lecture about playfulness, we get shown the same examples and it makes us feel like we have already seen it all. I would really appreciate seeing something new. Also, this is a very very broad topic and that makes it extremely difficult to research it.
What surprised me during my research was the fact that many of these playful interactions were created and tested by user researches and not designers. Many of the projects are very feasible with little knowledge of coding and the technology behind them is rather simple, which makes it very accessible to everyone who wants to try something similar out.  <p/>
